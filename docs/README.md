# Vulkan Tutorial

## Vulkan Instance

Instances of vulkan are instantiated to specify which extensions are required

## Validation Layers

The Validation layer is loaded dynamically and can be enabled when an instance is created, or it can be enabled dynamically through the ``vkconfig`` provided by ``vulkanSDK`` or ``RenderDoc`` .

## Physical device and logical device

**Physical Device:** A machine may have multiple physical devices, and a suitable physical device with a specific function can be selected.

**Logical Device:** Instantiate a logical device in order to specify which functions are required.

## Window Surface
Although the VkSurfaceKHR object and its usage is platform agnostic, its
creation isnâ€™t because it depends on window system details. For example,
it needs the HWND and HMODULE handles on Windows.

The ``glfwCreateWindowSurface`` function performs exactly this operation with
a different implementation for each platform.

## Swap chain

There are basically three kinds of properties we need to check:
* Basic surface capabilities (min/max number of images in swap chain, min/-
max width and height of images)
* Surface formats (pixel format, color space)
* Available presentation modes

```cpp
struct SwapChainSupportDetails
{
    VkSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR capabilities;
    std::vector<VkSurfaceFormatKHR> fromats;
    std::vector<VkPresentModeKHR> presentModes;
};
```
